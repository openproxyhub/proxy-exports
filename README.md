# Open Proxy Export – Live, Verified Proxy Lists

This repository publishes **continuously verified public proxies**, generated by an automated proxy monitoring system.  
The goal is to provide **high-quality**, **fresh**, and **easy-to-use** proxy lists with clear separation by protocol, country, and anonymity level.

Most public proxy lists online are scraped, outdated, and 80–95% dead.  
This project focuses on **quality over quantity** by only publishing proxies that are:

- Recently **UP**
- **Protocol-validated**
- In an **active lifecycle** state
- Successfully tested through real traffic
- Classified with **geo** and **anonymity** information

---

## ⭐ Key Features

### ✔ Only working proxies  
Every proxy in the list recently passed:
- A protocol test  
- An uptime test  

No dead or unverified proxies are included.

### ✔ Updated automatically  
A backend system monitors proxies around the clock and commits updated lists to GitHub whenever changes occur.

### ✔ Clean structure  
Choose proxies by:
- Protocol  
- Country  
- Anonymity level  
- Or use the **all-in-one list**

### ✔ TXT + JSON formats  
- `.txt` → simple plain `ip:port` lists  
- `.json` → includes extra metadata (country, latency, anonymity, timestamps, etc.)

## 📁 Repository Structure

### **Protocol-based lists**
At the root level:

- `http_absolute.txt` / `http_absolute.json`
- `http_connect.txt` / `http_connect.json`
- `https_proxy_tls.txt` / `https_proxy_tls.json`
- `socks4.txt` / `socks4.json`
- `socks5.txt` / `socks5.json`

TXT files contain:

ip:port
ip:port

JSON files include metadata like:

```json
{
  "ip": "198.51.100.23",
  "port": 8080,
  "protocol": "http_connect",
  "country": "US",
  "anonymity": "elite",
  "first_seen": "2025-10-02T16:58:34Z",
  "last_seen": "2025-11-10T17:23:19Z",
  "latency_ms": 850
}

All Proxies (Combined)

If you prefer one large list:

all_proxies.txt
all_proxies.json

proxies_by_country/
  US.txt
  SE.txt
  DE.txt
  BR.txt

anonymity/
  elite.txt
  anonymous.txt
  transparent.txt

These lists are based on how the proxy behaves during capability checks:

* elite → hides your real IP completely; no proxy headers
* anonymous → hides your IP but adds identifiable headers
* transparent → forwards your IP or exposes you

🛠 How the System Works (High-Level Overview)

This repository is powered by a custom backend system with several automated components.
Here is a simple overview:

1. Proxy Discovery

Proxies are added to a registry and assigned a lifecycle stage
(e.g., active_new, active_low, dead_stage_1, etc.).

2. Protocol Testing

A validator determines whether a proxy supports:

HTTP

HTTP CONNECT

HTTPS over TLS

SOCKS4

SOCKS5

Only proxies that pass protocol validation are eligible for export.

3. Uptime Monitoring

A separate uptime worker checks if the proxy is:

Reachable

Responding correctly

Stable over time

If a proxy has been DOWN too long, it is removed from exports.

4. Geo Detection

A geo worker determines:

Exit IP

Country

ASN / ISP

This is how country-based lists are generated.

5. Anonymity Checks

A capability probe tests:

Whether your real IP leaks

What headers the proxy adds

Whether the proxy reveals itself

This determines its anonymity level.

6. Exporting

A scheduled export script gathers only proxies that:

Are UP

Are protocol-validated

Are in an active lifecycle

Have valid geo/anonymity metadata

It then updates the TXT/JSON files and pushes changes to GitHub.

▶️ How to Use the Proxies
Curl (HTTP Proxy)
curl -x http://IP:PORT https://httpbin.org/ip

Curl (SOCKS5 Proxy)
curl --socks5-hostname IP:PORT https://httpbin.org/ip

Python Example
import json
proxies = json.load(open("all_proxies.json"))

elite = [p for p in proxies if p.get("anonymity") == "elite"]

print("Elite proxies:", elite[:5])

⚠️ Disclaimer

Public proxies can be:

Slow

Unstable

Unsafe for sensitive data

Always encrypt your traffic (HTTPS or similar).
These lists are provided as-is with no guarantees.

Usability ideas

Direct proxy submissions are not accepted because all proxies must go through the automated validation pipeline.
